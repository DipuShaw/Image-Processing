This code provides a comprehensive workflow for processing and analyzing TIFF images to extract and visualize pore or grain size distributions.
It includes steps for loading, normalizing, denoising, segmenting, calculating porosity, performing distance transforms, applying watershed 
segmentation, and plotting results using the Saltykov method and volume-weighted histograms. The entire workflow is designed to use actual
image data without introducing any random values.
